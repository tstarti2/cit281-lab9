# Lab 9: GitHub Learning Lab - Release Based Workflow

During this lab, I worked through the GitHub Learning Lab course "Create a release based workflow." Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

## Overview

The lab focused on learning about release-based workflows using GitHub through the self-directed course "Create a release based workflow" on GitHub Learning Lab. I created a Learning Lab course repository within my GitHub account and followed the steps provided in the course to understand managing releases in a collaborative development environment.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Creating Learning Lab Course/Repo Within GitHub Account:** I set up the GitHub Learning Lab course "Create a release based workflow" within my GitHub account to begin the learning process.
- **Practicing Exiting and Returning to the Course:** I familiarized myself with the Learning Lab interface and practiced exiting and returning to the course from the course repository as needed.
- **Working Through Course:** I followed the course's steps to learn about managing releases in a collaborative development environment using GitHub, gaining insights into release-based workflows.
- **Downloading Completed Course Repo:** Upon completing the course, I downloaded the completed course repository as a deliverable for the lab.

## Lab Structure

Throughout the lab, I followed a structured series of steps:
- **Part 1: Create Learning Lab Course/Repo Within Your GitHub Account:** I set up the GitHub Learning Lab course "Create a release based workflow" within my GitHub account.
- **Part 2: Practice Exiting and Returning to the Course from Course Repo:** I familiarized myself with the Learning Lab interface and practiced navigating between the course and the course repository.
- **Part 3: Work Through Course:** I followed the course's instructions to learn about release-based workflows using GitHub.
- **Part 4: Download Completed Course Repo as Deliverable:** After completing the course, I downloaded the completed course repository as a deliverable for the lab.

By completing this lab, I gained practical experience in using GitHub Learning Lab to understand release-based workflows, manage releases, and collaborate effectively in a development environment.
